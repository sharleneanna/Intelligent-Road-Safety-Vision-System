### Intelligent Road Safety Vision System  
*AICTE - Shell - Edunet Foundation Internship (AI/ML in Automotive)*

---

## Overview
An intelligent road-safety assistant built using computer vision and pretrained deep learning models.  
It analyzes road footage to detect vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles — providing the foundation for an AI-driven driver-assistance system.

---

## Week 1 Milestone – Base Object Detection
✅ Setup YOLOv8 pretrained model (Ultralytics)  
✅ Test on sample image `road_scene.jpg` and video `road_video.mp4`  
✅ Generate detection outputs and store results locally

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **YOLOv8** (Ultralytics)
- **OpenCV**
- **Hugging Face Transformers** *(future integration for risk analysis)*
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**

---

## Future Scope
**Week 2:**  
- Add traffic density estimation  
- Introduce near-miss detection and alerts  

**Week 3 (Final):**  
- Integrate with LLM for “Accident Risk Report” generation  
- Develop a presentation and finalize the demo
